• Voice Gateway: Cisco ISR 4321 with voice/video DSP modules for SIP trunking

COMPLIANCE FEATURES:
• Automated vulnerability scanning and patch management
• Quarterly PCI-DSS assessment reporting
• Encrypted data transmission (AES-256) for all cardholder data
• Role-based access controls with multi-factor authentication
• Comprehensive audit logging with tamper-proof storage
• Incident response automation with regulatory notification workflows

BANDWIDTH & CONNECTIVITY:
• Primary 100Mbps fiber connection with QoS prioritization
• Backup 50Mbps cellular failover through integrated 4G module
• Voice traffic priority with guaranteed bandwidth allocation
• Banking applications receive 80% bandwidth guarantee during peak hours" on cisco  devices.
